    Q1 How would you create a taxonomy to identify key customer trends in unstructured data?
    The best way to approach this question is to mention that it is good to check with the business owner and understand their objectives   before categorizing the data. Having done this, it is always good to follow an iterative approach by pulling new data samples and improving   the model accordingly by validating it for accuracy by soliciting feedback from the stakeholders of the business. This helps ensure that   your model is producing actionable results and improving over the time.
